    "lyrics": "Beef Rapp Lyrics[Produced by Metal Fingers]\n\n[Skit 1]\nNow I haven't eaten all day. How am I gonna do this man?\nYeah don't wait for her man, don't wait for her\nI'll tell you what man: come with me now and you know\nI'll get you some lunch, I'll hook you up with something\nI got a little bank, y'know, no problem\nI hear you, that's cool (Alright? It's cool)\nMan, can't you guys just wait here about a half hour, man?\nYo I'll be back man, I'm just gonna munch up a little bit man, I'm pretty hungry\nYo let him come back\n[Skit 2]\nHere you will find food for your body\nAs well as comfort for your troubled mind\nI'd really like some soup (Bread and butter)\nOf course my friend. What happened to your hand?\nOh, food at last!\n\n[Skit 3]\nHow did they get here?\nRegular storage procedure, the same as the other food\nWhat other food?\nFish (Food) protein (Fast for ya)\n\n[Skit 4]\nNow what happened?\nWell, the cop got\nThe next morning I went to the store to get some food\n(Bread and butter) They arrested me\nI'll save you (Thank you)\nWould you like a snack?\nThanks for the drink\n\n[Skit 5]\nOperation Doomsday complete\nAll your intercoms casualty and damage testing\n[Skit 6]\nEnough! You talk of the people's rights\nThe people have only those rights which I choose to give them\nAnd that's for their own good, believe me\nI do, DOOM\nThey disappoint me, they must work faster\nBut the prisoner-\nAh yes, the young traitor who has tried to turn my people against me\nWatch him. I have special plans for that one\n\n[Verse 1]\nBeef rap, could lead to getting teeth capped\nOr even a wreath for mom dukes on some grief crap\nI suggest you change your diet\nIt can lead to high blood pressure if you fry it\nOr even a stroke, heart attack, heart disease\nIt ain't no starting back once arteries start to squeeze\nTake the easy way out phony, until then\nThey know they wouldn't be talking that bologna in the bullpen\nSo disgusting, pardon self as I discuss this\nThey talk a wealth of shit and they ain't never seen injustice\nBust this, like a cold milk from out the toilet\nTwo batteries, some Brillo and some foil, heat'll boil it\nHe be better off on PC glued\nAnd it's a feud so don't be in no TV mood\nEvery week it's mystery meat, seaweed stewed\n(Food, we need food!)\n[Verse 2]\nHe wears a mask just to cover the raw flesh\nA rather ugly brother with flows that's gorgeous\nDrop dead joints hit the whips like bird shit\nThey need it like a hole in they head or a third tit\nHer bra smell, his card say, \"Aw Hell!\"\nBarred from all bars and kicked out the Carvel\nKeep a cooker where the jar fell\nAnd keep a cheap hooker that's off the hook like Ma Bell\nTop bleeding, maybe fella took the loaded rod gears\nStop feeding babies colored sugar-coated lard squares\nThe odd pair swears and God fears\nEven when it's rotten, we've gotten through the hard years\nI wrote this note around New Year's\nOff a couple of shots and a few beers, but who cares?\nEnough about me, it's about the beats\nNot about the streets and who food he 'bout to eat\nA rhyming cannibal who's dressed to kill and cynical\nWhether is it animal, vegetable or mineral\nIt's a miracle how he get so lyrical\nAnd proceed to move the crowd like a old negro spiritual\nFor a mil', do a commercial for Mello Yello\nTell them devils, \"Hell no, sell y'all own Jello\"\nWe hollow krills, she swallow pills\nHe follow flea collar three dollar bills\nAnd squealed for halal veal, if y'all appeal\nDig the real, it's how the big ballers deal\nTwirl a L after every meal (\"Food!\")\n[Verse 3]\nWhat up? To all rappers: shut up with your shutting up\nAnd keep a shirt on, at least a button-up\nYuck, is they rhymers or strippin' males?\nOut-of-work jerks since they shut down Chippendales\nThey chippin' nails, DOOM tippin' scales\nLet alone the pre-orders that's counted off shippin' sales\nThis one goes out to all my peoples skippin' bail\nDippin' jail, whippin' tail and sippin' ale\nLight the doobie 'til it glow like a ruby\nAfter which, they couldn't find the Villain, like Scooby\nHe's in the lab on some old Buddha Monk shit\nOverproof drunk shit, but who'd'a thunk it?\nPunk, try and ask why ours be better\nCould be the iron mask or the Cosby sweater\nYes, you, who's screwed by the dude on the CD, nude\n(\"We need food!\")58Embed"

About to throw 'em away\nWith the gold rings that make 'em don't fit like OJ\nUsually I take them off with Oil of Olay\nMCs is crabs in a barrel, pass the Old Bay\nHot as hell and it's a cold day, innit?\nWorking on a way that we can roll away tinted\nSome say the price of holding heat is often too high\nYou either be in a coffin or you be the new guy\nThe one that's too fly to eat shoo pie\nNever too busy when it comes down to you and I\n(Swear to God) A lot of niggas wish to die\nThey need to hold they horses, there's bigger fish to fry\nYou're on the list, if not, pick a number spot\nTen and a half Timbs is made to kick your bumba claat\nI coulda had a V-8\nF-150 quad cab but I'll be straight\nMoney comes and goes like that two bit hussy\nThat night that tried to rush me, Dwight, pass the dutchie\nSo I can calm down so they don't get it twisted\nTake it from the fire side, it won't get blistered\nGot it, what happened? Oh, it's not lit\nThese metal fingers be holding (Hot shit)\n\n[Verse 3: Count Bass D]\nWhen I was four, I penned \"God Was Born In New York\"\nBack in '77, still got nan in the crescent\nThe effervescence of God's presence is thick\nUnlike vapor, Esther Rolle, extra raw, word to the baker\nPeace to the hardworkin' gingerbread makers\nLooked her up and down; said, \"Hmm, too much makeup\"\nPoor music taste, ten years from being grown up\nRappers don't blow up, heads do (Aww, shit)\nMy name is Dwight Spitz, I'm a Sonic addict\nI use to think it was merely a nagging habit\nBorn under a bad sign, I'm serious about this curse of mine\nI strive to flip it into fine wine\n\"Barely born a virgin\" is what the stars said\nBlack not white, red all over, though, like Elmo\nTwenty-eight years have passed, I feel I'm peaking\nI make music every weekend\nIt's a chore, a fact of life, a labor of love\nI get mad love, but I detest the labor\nAnd its wages\u2014you know, death?\nI'm servin' life from this gift of God\nDon't forget your potholders, my niggas\n[Outro]\n(More hot shit)\n(More hot shit)\n(More hot shit)\nA short time later30Embed"

The pack comes in six!\nWhatever happened to two and three?\"\nA herb tried to slide with four and five\nAnd got caught like, \"What you doing, G?\"\nDon't make 'em have to get cutting like truancy\nMatter fact, not for nothing, right now, you and me!\"\nLooser than a pair of Adidas\nI hope you brought your spare tweeters\nMCs sound like cheerleaders\nRapping and dancing like Red Head Kingpin\nDOOM came to do the thing again, no matter who be blingin'\nHe do it for the smelly hubbies\nSeeds know what time it is like it's time for Teletubbies\nFew can do it, even fewer can sell it\nTake it from the dude who wear a mask like a 'tarded helmet\nHe plots shows like robberies\nIn and out \u2014 one, two, three \u2014 no bodies, please\nRun the cash and you won't get a wet sweatshirt\nThe mic is the shotty: nobody move, nobody get hurt\nBring heat like the boy done gone to war\nHe came in the door, and \"Everybody on the floor!\"\nA whole string of jobs like we on tour\nEvery night on the score, coming to your corner store\n[Skit 1]\nThere, it is done\nNow that the representative from South Africa has been\nMind programmed\nAll of the world leaders on earth are under my control\nAnd when they meet tomorrow in special session\nI, DOOM, shall be voted: Master of the World\nMy plan is foolproof, but just in case\nAnd what about snow?\n\n[Outro: Skit 2]\nNow you keep your eyes open\nWhen I tell ya, start snappin' (Oh yeah, sure)\nUh, ladies und gentlemen\nI am risking my life to tell you with, with great concern\nThat I must warn you, I, I\nYou must listen\nMany among you, have, have had their minds taken over\n(What a story, start snappin\u2019)\nDOOM, gosh, I wish I\u2019d brought my autograph book\n(Your attempts at humor bore me) Right, lead-head\nYou\u2019re weird\nWhy is everyone staring at us?\n(Aw, I should have realized, we must look like freaks to them)\nRelax masseur, just do your thing\n(Get a good grip on my\u2014)\nWhat?

A show of hands\n(Friends) is a term some people use loosely\nI'm real choosy on what I choose to let crew see\nYou telling me; I try to act broke\nJealousy the number one killer among black folk\nFellas be under some type of spell like crack smoke\nGhetto Cinderellas lead 'em right to your stack, loc\nJust another way a chick'll lead to your end\nI checked the dictionary for the meaning of friend\nIt said: \"person one likes to socialize with\nSympathizer, helper\", and that's about the size of it\nMost of the time these attributes is one-sided\nTo bolster the crime, they're apt to shoot you through your eyelid\nAnd they can't hide it, going wild like a white bitch\nSometimes ya need to cut niggas off like a light switch\n(Flick!) And when things get quiet\nCatch 'em like a thief in the night, what a riot\nI first met Mr. Fantastik at a arms deal\nDon't let it get drastic, think of how your moms'll feel\nWhen it get for real, steel get to sparkin'\nEverything darken, it ain't no talkin'\nFor somethin' so cheap, it sure buys a lot of trouble\nYa better off focusing than tryin' to plot to bubble\nOr else it'd be a sad note to end on, the guns we got is\n(One's we can depend on, friends)\nSome come in the form of co-dependents\nA lot of times only end up being co-defendants\nTen bucks say they tell for a lower sentence\nAnd leave you up under the jail, begging for repentance\nIt don't make no sense, what happened to the loyalty?\nHonor amongst crooks, trust among royalty\nI'd rather go out in a blaze than give 'em the glory\n(How many of us have\u2014) a similar story?\n(Friends) before lovers, we used to have some type of over-standing\nJust so when I let her get the man thing\nShe know it's no strings, we could do the damn thing\nBut ho, it's no rings, just how the tramp swings\nWill she see him again? That depends on\n\"How good was the skins?\" and \"Could she memorize the lessons?\"\nIt ain't no need to pretend\nEven though she let him stab it, she know they're just friends\n[Outro]\nFriends\nHow many of us have them?\nFriends\nOnes we can depend on?\nFriends\nHow many of us have them?\nFriends\nBefore we go any further\n\n[Skit]\nFellas! Don't be silly! I know who my friends are!\nAnd the next nice neighborhood I move into, you guys'll get crack'\n(Negro humor always escaped me.)\n\n[Outro Skit: Character 1; Mr. Fantastic; (Invisible Woman);\nDr. DOOM; Character 2]\nThe most powerful, the most mysterious monarch in all the world\nGuided by a fighting force that never sleeps\nThat never relaxes its vigilance\nFor none is as feared, none has as many foes\nAs DOOM, the awesome armorclad lord of\nI know who Doom is (Then tell us)\nHe happens to be the most dangerous man in the world\nI\u2019d hope we\u2019d never hear from him\nI\u2019d hope we\u2019d never have to battle him\nBut now the worst has happened and I must tell you what we\u2019re up against\nI first met DOOM years ago\nWhen he wanted to be alone, alone to pursue his forbidden experiments\nOne day while conducting a secret experiment\n[Explosion sounds] Later, when he recovered from his injuries\nInstead of having learned his lesson, DOOM was bitter, angry, vengeful\n[Woman screams] What have I done to myself?\nMy face, it is hideous\nHe traveled the world, seeking a cure for his disfigured face\n(I\u2019m sorry sir, there is nothing we can do for you)\nHe traveled through remote villages, where strangers are seldom seen\nHe continued his search, never showing his face\nUnless threatened by bandits who prey on travelers\nWho foolishly wander alone through their domain32Embed"

That was loud!\nGot to ya, huh?\n\nHere's an interesting note: artificial colors\nYellows or Reds\nLet's focus on the red\nIn addition to FD&C Red Number 40, the FDA has approved certain food coloring additives, some are actually poison!\nIf you aren't sure of the additives or colorings in the products you've purchased, leave it alone!\nPoison!\nBad news!\nThat's right!\n\nThank you\nWell, I think that about covers all of the natural foods out here\nNow then, I have to go take my dessert here\nI have to go\nI'm conducting a cooking class today\nGood health to you all!\nUh, over this way\nLook out!\n\nAlright Pops, still feel like charging me for that meal?\nOne look at his feature-less face\nOne look was enough to ensure his safety\nAs years passed, he became even more bitter and angry\nBurning with vengeance against the world\nFinally, amidst hidden scrolls, he found what he'd been seeking\nThen, clothed in a suit of invulnerable armor, and possessing the worlds greatest secrets of science and magic, he returned to his homeland\nAnd there he has remained\nScheming, dreaming, planning\nPlotting his mad campaign to conquer the entire world\n(I can't believe it!)\n(Alright, alright, don't make a big deal about it)\nI warn you DOOM, you've gone too far\n(Yeah!)\nThat'll do it DOOM, get your machine1Embed"

He intends to destroy all of us if I persist in refusing him, even now!\"\n\n[Verse 1: Angelika]\nSheitan never came so ill, he got skill\nMet a brother from the grill that gave my spine chills\nAll thirty three nerves, controlling my curves\nCommon sense just swerved every time I got served\nStress, frustration, empty rhetoric\nCold as winter in Connecticut, compassion lacking deficit\nThought it was love like, sent from above, you not a soulmate\nMore ways and actions of a primate\nWho by low and census coming faker than extensions\nPissed away all good intentions, outta here sister was missin'\nIntuition, maybe it was me, I couldn't see\nHolding onto fantasy, getting bitten by reality\n[Hook: 4ize]\nWar wound, purple heart, love veteran\nMorphine, pain killers, drugs and medicine\nAnything just to forget the hurt\nIncoming! Take cover, hit the dirt\nOn the front-line, there's casualties in the mind\nAnd the POW's get left behind\nMentally scarred for life, love is war\nAnd some chicks are just too hard to wife\n\n[Verse 2: Angelika]\nI shoulda deaded it from genesis instead of hittin' the Guinnesses\nNow I'm free falling, cursing at the street, bawling\nHe ceased calling, no appetite for feast darling\nSo deep all in, I bet he never stop balling women\nForsake God for the sin of a man\nSacrifice a whole life for a slice, overstand?\nMaybe it's a lack of pigment, loneliness imagine figment\nOnly got the car tinted to pull extra G's in it\nDamn Jody, comin with the okie doke, pokie poke\nSteady rockin boats, got me aimin for ya throats\nSniper scope, weren't we supposed to elope?\nPropose then ya froze, I don't think that I can cope\n\n[Hook: 4ize]\nWar wound, purple heart, love veteran\nMorphine, pain killers, drugs and medicine\nAnything just to forget the hurt\nIncoming!

In love with Mary Jane, she's my main thing\nPulled her right from that web head, what a lame brain\nMaintain and say it, don't spray it\nYou wanna see your girl again, you might as well pay it\nIf I had a dime for every rhymer's that bust guns\nI'd have a cool mil' for my sons in trust funds\nWhen I was broker than a broke dick dog\nI always kept a L to smoke in thick fog\nWhen it rain, it sure do thunderstorm\nI got more rhymes in the summer than musty underarms\nOne, two, microphone checker\nFirst learned to neck off a Home Ec homewrecker\nThis is back when he was like crib age\nWhen he hit the stage, it's like a gauge to the rib cage\nBreak the mic like a rock star break a guitar\nAnd jump off the stage like \"Yee haw!\"\n[Outro Skit]\n(UN leader): We shall now vote for a new world leader.

What are you doing? That's so nasty!\"\nIt might seem ill\n\"Ew! Go wash your hands!\" (No)\nKookies\n\"Get out of here!\"\n[Outro: Samples]\n\"DOOM is master of the world.\"\n\"I'd sure hate to see that ugly mug of yours in my history book.\"\n\"You've disturbed me for the last time.\"\n(Voice 1): Hey, y'know something gang, that DOOM ain't really all bad\n(Voice 2): What do you mean, Ben?\n(Voice 1): Well, on account of him I had me a real good time. Y'know, I mean, between you and me I kinda like being black\n(Voice 3): Well, maybe if we're lucky he'll attack us once more and send you back, Benjamin\n(Voice 1): Ah-haha very funny, very very funny\n(Voice 2): He must be mad\n(Voice 4): Well, if anyone can do it. Nevertheless let's get out of here, while we can\n(Misc. Voice): Food, we need food13Embed"
